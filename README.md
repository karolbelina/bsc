My Bachelor of Science thesis supervised by dr inż. Zdzisław Spławski at the Wrocław University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Computer Science and Management, Computer Science.

Check out the [compiled PDF](https://karolbelina.github.io/bsc/W08_242499_2020_praca_inżynierska.pdf).

## Building

Before building, please make sure you have Latexmk available in your LaTeX environment, as well as [Inkscape 1.0](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.0/) or newer installed on your system. Also make sure that the newest release of [wizthesis](https://github.com/karolbelina/wizthesis) document class is in the root directory of the project.

To build the thesis, first run
```
./build_svgs.sh
```
to convert SVG images to `.pdf` and `.pdf_tex` files, and then run Latexmk with
```console
latexmk
```
to build the PDF.

Additionally, you can invoke `latexmk -c` to clear the temporary files generated by `latexmk`.
